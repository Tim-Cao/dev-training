## Liferay Portal Services

- portal-kernel: provides interfaces and utils

- portal-impl: provides service implementations that implement those interfaces


## Liferay Module Services
- Service Builder: a model-driven code generation tool
  
      service.xml

- For Gradle Project, running the following command in module projectâ€™s root folder
 
      gradlew buildService
  
- *-api module: Service Builder generates classes and interfaces belonging to the persistence layer, service layer, and model layer
      
      *Persistence: Persistence interface that defines CRUD methods for the entity such as create, remove, countAll, find, findAll, etc.
      
      *Util: Persistence utility class that wraps *PersistenceImpl and provides direct access to the database for CRUD operations. 
            This utility should only be used by the service layer.
            In your portlet classes, use *LocalServiceUtil or *ServiceUtil instead.
      
      *LocalService: Local service interface.
      
      *LocalServiceUtil: Local service utility class which wraps *LocalServiceImpl and serves as the primary local access point to the service layer.
      
      *Service: Remote service interface.
      
      *ServiceUtil: Remote service utility class which wraps *ServiceImpl and serves as the primary remote access point to the service layer.
      
- *-service module: The implementation of the interfaces defined in the *-api module
      
      *PersistenceImpl: Persistence implementation class that implements *Persistence.
      
      *LocalServiceImpl: Local service implementation.
      
      *ServiceImpl: Remote service implementation.
      
      *Model: Base model interface.
      
      *Impl: Model implementation.
      
      *Service: Remote service interface.
      
- Note:

      Shouldn't customize any of Persistence classes or interfaces.
      
      Only three should be manually modified: *LocalServiceImpl, *ServiceImpl and *Impl.
      
      Service Builder adds corresponding methods to the *LocalService, *Service and *Model interface the next time you run it.
