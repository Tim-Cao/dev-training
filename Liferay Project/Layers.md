## Persistence Layer

- Application’s persistence layer persists data represented by configured entities to a database. 

- In fact, local service implementation classes are responsible for calling the persistence layer to retrieve and store application’s data.


## Service Layer

- Both a local service implementation and a remote service implementation have been created for a particular service.

### Local Services

### Services (Remote Services)

- The remote service performs a permission check and then invokes the corresponding local service.
