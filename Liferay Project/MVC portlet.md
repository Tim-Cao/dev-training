## Tree Layers

- With Service Builder, the *model* layer is generated into a *service* and an *api* module. That accounts for the model in the MVC pattern. 

- The *view* and the *controller* share a module, the *web* module.

- A module that publishes a portlet component with the necessary properties.

- Controller code to handle the request and response.

- JSPs to implement your view layer.
