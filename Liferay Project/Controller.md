## Controller: The middle man in the MVC pattern, the Controller contains logic for passing the data back and forth between the view and the model layers.

- In MVC, your controller receives requests from the front-end, and it pulls data from the back-end. Itâ€™s a traffic director: 

      It provides data to the right front-end view for display to the user,
      
      and it takes data the user entered in the front-end and passes it to the right back-end service. 

      For this reason, the controller must process requests from the front-end,
      
      and it must determine the right front-end view to pass data back to the user.
